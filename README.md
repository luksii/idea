# Squirrel Gold Rush
This is a simple sandbox game with random terrain generation, where you play
as a squirrel trying to collect as many golden hazelnuts as possible to stock
up for the winter. You have a 5 minute time limit to collect as many as possible.
After the time limit expires, your score automatically resets and you can play again.

This game is written entirely in C++ using GLFW and Open GL version 4.2.
